      <h2>PC Parts in Plain English</h2>
      <p>
        This page breaks down each major PC component in simple terms. If you’ve never
        built a PC before, think of this section as a guide to what each part does,
        why it matters, and how it affects your gaming experience.

        <h3>Central Processing Unit (Processor)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>CPU:</strong> The CPU is the brain of the computer. It handles instructions,
          calculations, and decision-making for everything your PC does.
        </p>
        <p>
          In gaming, the CPU manages things like game logic, character behavior,
          physics calculations, and background tasks. If your CPU is too weak,
          you may experience stuttering, slow loading, or poor performance even
          if you have a powerful graphics card. Some games use the CPU more than the GPU.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Graphics Processing Unit (Graphics Card)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>GPU:</strong> The GPU is responsible for rendering images, videos,
          and everything you see on the screen while gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the most important part for gaming performance. A strong GPU
          allows higher frame rates, better visual quality, and smoother gameplay.
          Without a capable GPU, modern games may run poorly or not at all.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Random Access Memory (Memory)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>RAM:</strong> RAM is short-term memory that your computer uses to
          store the information it needs right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          When gaming, RAM helps keep the game running smoothly by holding active
          data like textures, maps, and background processes. Too little RAM can
          cause freezing, slowdowns, or crashes, especially when multitasking. A good 
          rule of thumb is 8 to 16 gigabytes (GB) of RAM.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Storage (SSD / HDD)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Storage is where your operating system, games,
          and files are permanently saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solid State Drives (SSDs) load games and applications much faster than
          traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs). Faster storage means shorter boot
          times, quicker game loading, and a more responsive system overall.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Motherboard:</strong> The motherboard is the main circuit board
          that connects all components.
        </p>
        <p>
          It allows your CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and power supply to communicate.
          The motherboard also determines what parts are compatible and what
          features your PC can support, such as upgrade options and expansion slots. 
          Picking the right motherboard is very important because it dictates the rest
          of your build!

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Power Supply Unit (Power Supply)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>PSU:</strong> The power supply provides electricity to every
          component in your PC.
        </p>
        <p>
          A reliable PSU ensures stable power delivery and protects your system
          from electrical issues. Using a low-quality or underpowered PSU can
          lead to crashes, system instability, or even permanent hardware damage.
